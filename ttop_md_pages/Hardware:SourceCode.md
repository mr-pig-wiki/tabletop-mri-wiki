[**Click
here**](https://tabletop.martinos.org/images/4/44/MRI_GUIs_v6p0.zip) for
the up-to-date **V6.0Matlab GUI** files used in MIT 6.S03 in Spring
2017.

NOTE: We have had trouble getting the MEDUSA drivers to work on Windows
8 computers. Therefore we can not guarantee that the GUIs will run
properly on Windows 8 and for the time being recommend using Windows 7
or XP. We are looking into the compatibility issue.

**INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS**:

1.  Download and unzip to get the folder MRI_GUIs_v6.0.
2.  Follow driver installation instructions on this website:
    <https://web.archive.org/web/20170701233007/http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~medusa/software/>.
    Plug in the MEDUSA and turn it on, run the libusb-win32 installer
    (in the "bin" folder of the download), choose "unknown device" for
    the driver install, and then install the driver in the "medusa"
    subfolder of the GUI download package. For an alternative website
    for downloading the libusb-win32 installer, please see this link:
    [1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/). *NOTE: Some
    users have reported problems installing the libusb-win32 driver on
    Windows 10 due to a new "driver signature enforcement" security
    feature. Driver signature enforcement may need to be disabled to
    proceed with the install.*
3.  Run the file "MRI_launchpad.bat" to automatically open Matlab and
    the Launchpad tool.
4.  Make sure that all subfolders are in the Matlab path so that the
    MEDUSA drivers can be accessed.
5.  (Optional) Create a shortcut to the file "MRI_launchpad.bat" and
    drag it on the Desktop. Right click on the icon and choose
    "properties". Choose "change icon" and then use "browse" to select
    the file "mit_mri_logo.ico". This shortcut will now automatically
    bring up Matlab and the launchpad.

  using a spin echo for the frequency finder to help when the shim is

- Suggestion: gradient nonlinear correction along y direction (JPS)
- Suggestion: B1 mapping sequence (JPS)
- Suggestion: FLASH double-echo B0 mapping sequence (JPS)

  on the fly, but does not save the averaged data! Thanks! Elfar~~
- Check the save data button in IMAGING_GUI_3

## Gradient calibration info

- Scale factor to change MEDUSA units into Amperes of output current
  (approx.): 10.8 amps per MEDUSA_unit
- To go from MEDUSA units into a physical unit of Hz/cm, use this
  conversion: \[x, y, z\] --\> \[142,500, 142,500, 204,150\] Hz/cm per
  MEDUSA_unit
- This implies that to get Hz/cm per Ampere of current in the coils, use
  this conversion: \[x, y, z\] --\> \[ 13,231, 13,231, 18,955\] Hz/cm
  per Amp

<!-- -->

- GPA boards are configured with gain = 1 so that 1V input sets the
  output to 1A.

## Description of GUIs

The GUIs let students acquire data, view the Fourier transform of the
data on-screen, vary basic pulse sequence parameters (such as TE and
TR), and save the raw data to a Matlab .mat file.

## FID_GUI

<a href="/File:FID_GUI_basic_screenshot.png" class="wikilink"
title="600px|thumb|right|FID GUI">600px|thumb|right|FID GUI</a>

The FID GUI runs a "one pulse" experiment that acquires a free induction
decay and displays the Fourier transform lineshape. The GUI also lets
students run a flip angle calibration to find the 90 deg and 180 deg RF
pulses amplitudes. The shim can be set either using the "auto shim" tool
or by hand using the slider bars or text fields.

## SE_PROJ_GUI

<a href="/File:SE_PROJ_GUI_spin_echo_no_shim.png" class="wikilink"
title="600px|thumb|right|SE_PROJ_GUI">600px|thumb|right|SE_PROJ_GUI</a>

The spin echo/projection GUI shows the evolution of the spins in a
two-pulse experiment with and without dephase/rephase gradient lobes.
Students can see the effect of shimming on the shape of the spin echo.
They can also see how applying gradient lobes along each direction
creates a 1-D projection of the object instead of a narrow lineshape.

title="600px|thumb|right|SE_PROJ_GUI">600px|thumb|right|SE_PROJ_GUI</a>

## IMAGING_GUI_1

<a href="/File:IMAGING_GUI_1_screenshot.png" class="wikilink"
title="600px|thumb|right|IMAGING_GUI_1">600px|thumb|right|IMAGING_GUI_1</a>

IMAGING_GUI_1 lets students acquire a 2D spin echo image (no
slice-direction encoding). Students must set the maximum gradient
amplitude for the readout and phase encoding gradients in order to
achieve the desired FOV. The GUI displays the acquired k-space data.
Students then process k-space offline with the FFT to create the image.

## IMAGING_GUI_2

<a href="/File:IMAGING_GUI_2_screenshot.png" class="wikilink"
title="600px|thumb|right|IMAGING_GUI_2">600px|thumb|right|IMAGING_GUI_2</a>

IMAGING_GUI_2 automatically computes read and phase encoding amplitudes
for a desired FOV and resolution. Students can acquire 2-D spin echo and
turbo spin echo (RARE) data and view the resulting images inside the
GUI.

The upper left plot shows the pulse sequence being played by the
scanner.

For spin echo acquisitions, the GUI displays each readout and projection
(FFT'ed readout) in real time while updating the 2-D k-space figure and
corresponding image. The partial images are computed from a zero-padded
k-space matrix. This illustrates how high frequency components near the
edge of k-space provide edges and details while the central lines of
k-space provide most of the signal and contrast in the image.

## IMAGING_GUI_3

<a href="/File:IMAGING_GUI_3_with_image.png" class="wikilink"
title="600px|thumb|right|IMAGING_GUI_3">600px|thumb|right|IMAGING_GUI_3</a>

IMAGING_GUI_3 acquires 3-D turbo spin echo images and displays the
results in a separate window.
