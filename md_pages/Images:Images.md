Here are some example images from the system. Below is a 2D single shot
RARE (72 echoes zero padded out to 96x96 image matrix) of our 10mm
"star" phantom printed in ABS plastic (and water). Average of 4 shots
(roughly 4 second acquisition).

Below is a 3D TSE mouse brain and an MIT letter phantom with the letters
"M" "I" "T" stacked so you need a 3D sequence to separate them.
